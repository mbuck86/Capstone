Capstone Project Proposal for Springboard
Author: Michael Buck

Part 1: Problem Statement and Purpose

Does doing well in high school, especially doing well on standardized tests,
help you succeed later in life? This is a question that never leaves my mind, as
someone who educates high school students for a living. Do the selection
criteria of universities lead them to having more successful students? Are there
common traits among universities that have high graduation rates or financially
succesful students? I am interested in finding the answers to these questions
primarily to see if the standards that we hold students to actually measure what
their achievement might be later in life. It would be interesting to have this
information to allow students to know what traits to look for in a university
that may be the most likely to lead them to a more finincially fulfilling life.
It would also be useful to see if selective universities give their students who
worked hard to get accepted a return on their investment of time and hard work
later in life.


Part 2: The Data and Problem Solving Process

The data that I am using to try to form an answer to these questions comes from
the US government created website called the college scorecard. This data is
readily available from the US government's data website. The College Scorecard
contains an enormous amount of data, but here are some of the pertinent
variables that the data set contains: 

-25th and 75th percentiles of scores of students admitted for both SAT and ACT, 
-Average SAT equivalent scores
-Four year and six year graduation rates
-Earnings data from students both six years and ten years after entering school

Using these variables and possibly a few more I think it might be possible to
figure out what common traits universities with high graduation rates and
students with high salaries after school have in common. I think it may be
viable to create some sort of linear model that can predict future salary
prospects of students based on the entry criteria of various universities. 
  
Part 3: Deliverables

My deliverables for this project will be a report detailing the findings of my
analysis and a slide deck detailing the highlights of my  results, with proper
data visualizations, and advice for students on what they might want to do to
maximize their finincial and academic success after high school.
